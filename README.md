**Forked from [Three.js Fundamentals](https://github.com/gfxfundamentals/threejsfundamentals).**

For many of us, [3 Dreams of Black](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/3-dreams-of-black) (an old Chrome experiment) was our one of our first contacts with WebGL. It was utterly impressive for its time (and it still is, if you ask me). Then, [Gregg Tavares aka greggman](https://github.com/greggman) used the same flamingo model, to create a scene of similar aesthetics, that he used as a background to the homepage of this project, named [Three.js Fundamentals](https://github.com/gfxfundamentals/threejsfundamentals). It was a great tutorial to Three.js and it has been incorporated into the official Three.js docs. An old version where you can see the background, is still available [here](https://r105.threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/background.html).

As the code is quite dated by today's standards, I decided to fork it and to try to modernize it, while maintaining the exact same visual output. The project doesn't have a larger purpose, it's just my tiny love letter to Three.js, and ,hopefully, a good excercise in my learning process.

## Roadmap
### Done
* Three.js as an import
* Update Three.js and all packages to latest version
* Remove/update obsolete code
* Refactor and reorganize code
* Clean up any code residuals
* Add dat.GUI

### Plans
* Use original postprocessing and shaders to achieve the exact same visual output (shadows etc.)
* Make more parameters editable

## Changelog
I am not keeping a changelog, but the original parsed filed without the modifications can be found in the [initial commit](https://github.com/michaelkolesidis/flamingos/commit/006643c55f2699b36405107fca0e48efa25f5877).
